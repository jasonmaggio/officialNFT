# officialNFT
● What the project does
OfficialNFT® is a dynamic NFT ecosystem that enables individuals, artists, brands and entities
to mint and deploy a suite of highly customizable smart contracts in a well-curated marketplace
with optimal user experience for both minters and end retail buyers
● Why the project is useful
OfficialNFT® is a seamless marketplace that allows creators to easily use our innovative tools
and UI to craft whatever NFT they need or have a use case for with ease. It is designed to be
used at any level, from the student artist to the creative professional. ”No code” NFTs with a host
of options and capabilities.
● How users can get started with the project
OfficialNFT® at this stage is only open to collaborators and invitees. At our next phase invited
users will be able to mint NFTs once they hold $OFCL token and create a user profile. The NFTs
minted are then approved by the admin and made live on the site. We are working closely with
minters to collect feedback, iterate smart contracts and UI to find product/market fit.
